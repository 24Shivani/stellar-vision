# RELIEF CONNECT - Connect for rescue and relief

This is a disaster relief and rescue aid. It aims to reduce the issue of fragmented response by various organizations during the times of floods. This solution is a web based app.

This product aims at building two interfaces- 
- Portal for users to send alerts for rescue, food/water supplies, power and report missing/stranded person report with no login required for first time access. Request and alert will be validated via GPS.
- Portal for NDRF (National Disaster Relief Force), various NGOs, logistics companies etc. for notifying them the alerts.

### Tech Stack
We aim to use PWA (Progressive Web App Technology) to implement this idea, as it provides better connectivity and works during power outage, low internet connectivity.
