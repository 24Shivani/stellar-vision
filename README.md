# RELIEF CONNECT - Connect for rescue and relief

This is a disaster relief and rescue aid. It aims to reduce the issue of fragmented response by various organizations during the times of floods. This solution is a web based app.

This product aims at building two interfaces- 
- Portal for users to send alerts for rescue, food/water supplies, power and report missing/stranded person report with no login required for first time access. Request and alert will be validated via GPS.
- Portal for NDRF (National Disaster Relief Force), various NGOs, logistics companies etc. for notifying them the alerts.

### Tech Stack
We aim to use PWA (Progressive Web App Technology) to implement this idea, as it provides better connectivity and works during power outage, low internet connectivity.

  ## Inspiration
During natural calamities, people face a myriad of challenges, including a fragmented response, lack of information sharing, inefficient resource allocation, communication gaps, and difficulties in volunteer coordination. Relief Connect addresses these challenges and thus contributing to a more compassionate and effective relief effort during times of crisis.

## What it does
The Relief Connect project serves as a comprehensive platform for disaster response and relief coordination. It places importance on community engagement, offering a platform for affected communities to communicate their needs, provide feedback, and actively participate in the relief process. Serving as a coordination hub, the platform allows different relief organizations, government agencies, and volunteers to collaborate in real-time. 
The Relief Connect website incorporates a mapbox to efficiently track the locations of individuals affected by a disaster. Users are empowered to mark their locations on the map using color-coded dotsâ€”red for immediate help, orange for food and water supplies, and yellow for power and gasoline assistance. This intuitive system allows for a quick and visual representation of urgent needs in specific areas. Rescue teams, equipped with access to the map, can easily interpret the colored dots and respond promptly to the identified needs.
The platform extends its utility beyond just rescue teams. Various NGOs and logistic companies also have access to the website, enabling them to address the specific needs of afflicted people. This collaboration fosters a more coordinated and comprehensive response to the challenges posed by a natural calamity. NGOs can analyze the map data to identify areas with high concentrations of urgent needs and strategically deploy their resources. 
The platform exemplifies the potential of technology to enhance coordination and responsiveness in the face of natural disasters, ultimately contributing to more efficient and targeted assistance for affected communities.

## How we built it
The site was built with a React, Tailwind, JavaScript, Vercel, Mapbox, HTML5 and CSS. We started by looking into some wireframes to get a basic idea of how to layout the pages as required. The agreed-upon theme was integrated into a basic design system with tailwind, setting theme colors and fonts globally. The pages were created as server-side components using next's new app router. We relied on templates for starting points for the layout and design, but then used a combination of tailwind and the inline style prop to customize everything.  

## Challenges we ran into
Building the Relief Connect project with the React, Tailwind, Mapbox presented its own set of challenges. One significant challenge was ensuring seamless integration and communication between the frontend and backend components. Creating a cohesive design system with Tailwind and integrating the agreed-upon theme across pages required meticulous planning. While wireframes provided a basic layout, customization using a combination of Tailwind and inline styles posed a challenge, required to balance the flexibility of customization with consistency in design. Moreover, Additionally, the decision to deploy the project on Vercel, while a logical choice for Next.js projects, might have presented challenges in configuring the deployment settings, ensuring proper environment configurations, and handling any platform-specific nuances.
Additionally, collaborative challenges during the development process could have arisen from the need for effective communication and coordination among team members. Clear communication and proper documentation were likely crucial in addressing challenges related to code integration, feature implementation, and ensuring that everyone was aligned with the project's goals.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team takes immense pride in the accomplishments achieved during the development of the Relief Connect project. One major achievement lies in our ability to efficiently plan and execute strategic workflows within a limited timeframe, resulting in the successful delivery of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Relief Connect. Beyond the efficient delivery of Relief Connect, we are particularly proud of creating something that holds substantial utility and impact for our society. Designing a platform that contributes to disaster relief and rescue aid signifies our commitment to addressing critical societal needs and making a positive difference during times of crisis. Another source of pride stems from the learning journey of our novice team members who engaged with cutting-edge technologies, despite being initially unfamiliar with some tools. This reflects our team's dedication to continuous learning and the ability to adapt to new technologies to bring innovative solutions to life. 
The collaborative experiences with the Impact Hacks team and their Discord community have been invaluable. Connecting with like-minded individuals, participating in live hack sessions, and learning from the experiences of both our team members and the broader Impact Hacks community have enriched our development process. This collaborative environment has not only fostered a sense of community but has also provided opportunities for mutual learning and growth.

## What we learned
 Building a comprehensive disaster relief platform over a weekend is undoubtedly a substantial undertaking, yet the experience was not only a lot of work but also immensely enjoyable. The main takeaway from our endeavor is the recognition of what can be achieved when the team is aligned on objectives and leverages individual strengths effectively. The acknowledgment that starting with basic tools, even using fundamental HTML and CSS, can be incredibly powerful, especially when the focus is on refining and implementing the core idea. This reinforced the idea that frameworks, while beneficial for rapid development, should not overshadow the simplicity that allows broad team participation. By choosing simple tools initially, the team was able to ensure that everyone, regardless of their familiarity with specific technologies, could actively contribute to the project.
